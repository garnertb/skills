# AI tools

## Skills

A collection of specialized skills for AI agents to perform specific tasks effectively.

## Validation

To ensure the integrity and functionality of the skills, a validation script is provided. This script checks for the presence of required files and verifies the syntax of skill definitions.

To validate all skills, run the following command in your terminal:

```bash
./scripts/validate-skills
```

To validate a specific skill, provide the skill name as an argument:

```bash
./scripts/validate-skills <skill-name>
```
